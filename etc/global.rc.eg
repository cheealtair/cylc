# How to create a site or user global.rc config file.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The "cylc get-global-config" command prints - in valid global.rc format -
# system global defaults, overridden by site global settings (if any),
# overridden by user global settings (if any).
#
# Therefore, to generate a new global config file, do this:
#   % cylc get-global-config > global.rc
# edit it as needed and install it in the right location (below).
#
# For legal config items, see the User Guide's global.rc reference appendix.
#
# FILE LOCATIONS:
#----------------------
# SITE: delete or comment out items that you do not need to change (otherwise
# you may unwittingly override future changes to system defaults).
#
# The SITE FILE LOCATION is [cylc-dir]/etc/global.rc, where [cylc-dir] is your
# install location, e.g. /opt/cylc/cylc-7.7.0.
#
# FORWARD COMPATIBILITY: The site global.rc file must be kept in the source
# installation (i.e. it is version specific) because older versions of Cylc
# will not understand newer global config items. WHEN YOU INSTALL A NEW VERSION
# OF CYLC, COPY OVER YOUR OLD SITE GLOBAL CONFIG FILE AND ADD TO IT IF NEEDED.
#
#----------------------
# USER: delete or comment out items that you do not need to change (otherwise
# you may unwittingly override future changes to site or system defaults).
#
# The USER FILE LOCATIONS are:
#   1) ~/.cylc/<CYLC-VERSION>/global.rc  # e.g. ~/.cylc/7.7.0/global.rc
#   2) ~/.cylc/global.rc
# If the first lcoation is not found, the second will be checked.
# 
# The version-specific location is preferred - see FORWARD COMPATIBILITY above.
# WHEN YOU FIRST USE A NEW VERSION OF CYLC, COPY OVER YOUR OLD USER GLOBAL
# CONFIG FILE AND TO IT IF NEEDED. However, if you only set a items that don't
# change from one version to the next, you may be OK with the second location.
